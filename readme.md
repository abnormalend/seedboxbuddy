# SeedBoxBuddy
(readme a work in progress)

## Quick Start
- Copy the sample config to settings.ini, and add your seedbox credentials.
- Run sbb.py

## What it does
Automatically download from your seedbox on the schedule you define, and label torrents once they've been downloaded.

## Features
### Download Schedule
Set a start and stop time to control when your downloads happen, like in the middle of the night.
### Control Downloads by Label
Define a list of labels to ignore, label torrents that are in the middle of downloading, and then mark torrents that have been finished downloading so you know they can be deleted when you are finished seeding.
### Choose your download order
Supports 4 different orders of downloading:
- smallest
- largest
- oldest
- newest
## Notes
- Requires ruTorrent
